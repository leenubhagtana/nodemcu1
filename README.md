1.Hardware:
The project leverages the ESP32 microcontroller, chosen for its powerful capabilities and built-in WiFi functionality. 
2. Libraries :
The WiFi and Blynk libraries play a pivotal role in ensuring robust WiFi connectivity and seamless integration with the Blynk platform
For intitiating Softapi esp_wifi.h library is used.
The connection to the Blynk platform is facilitated through the BlynkSimpleEsp32 library, streamlining the integration process.

Happy codding
